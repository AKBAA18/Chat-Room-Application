# Chat-Room-Application
 TCP-based chat room app for real-time communication. Users authenticate to join and exchange messages in a group setting. Mimics live chat environment.
#Makefile - here I have used the utility programming for automation 
The goal of this project is to develop a command-line-based chat room application that allows multiple users to communicate in real-time. The application will be built using TCP sockets to ensure reliable communication between clients and a central server. Each user will be required to authenticate themselves before joining the chat room. Once authenticated and connected, users should be able to send and receive messages with everyone in the group, thereby simulating a real-time chat environment
